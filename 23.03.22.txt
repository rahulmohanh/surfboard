The second day of internship was over today by 6:45 pm,It was pretty much interesting as we were introduced to something which was new for all of us.We reached at the office by 8:45 am,had breakfast, talked to each other for almost half an hour and met our respective mentors.we were given variety of tasks, mine was to read a book i choose a book which was written by Raghu Raman (Everyman's War:Strategy,Security and Terrorism in India),throughout the book the author highlights what Naxal terrorists have common with somali pirates, what manmade events triggers more refugees than all wars put together,how do terrorist movements end, the book was almost 240 pages from which I could read only 20 pages today.When I searched about the author i got to know that Mr raghu Raman served decades in
 Indian military and the book which he wrote was based on incidents that he had gone through, while reading the book during the breaks I had a curiosity regarding the company (surfboard),It was what makes surfboard payments different from
other payment methords such as Googlepay or Phonepay.I searched online on the website and found out various information such as, payments through surfboard has no transaction limits, the smartphones which are used for payments acts as payment terminal and payments can be done through NFC (Near Field communiction) which enables communication between 2 electronic devices over a distance of 4cm or 
less. But my doubts were not clear so I enquired about this to Mr vinal who worked with testing team,He was happy to help me and he cleared my doubt,and i understood that in Google pay or phonepay,they helped in payment between a person to another,a person and a merchant with the help of QR code of the number registered within the app,But surfboard payments focus on payment in business level application or merchant transaction with the help of NFC or swish (QR code in sweden)Then we had lunch, after lunch we had a session which was guided by Mr kaushik who introduced us to basic programing codes in VIM ,how to create a folder using a command,how to open a file,how to create a file, how to save inserted text files,how to directly quit without saving,how to save and quit at once etc,and he assigned us with 2 homeworks which mainly focused on problem solving among which one was about a person holding 2 jars (3ltr&5ltr) how do we get exactly 4 ltrs without any measurement?, session was over by 5;30 and we reached on our appartment by 7pm.
