we reported at the office by 8:55 am, we had our breakfast and got into our 
works.I had to watch a video which gave an introduction to HTML, since I had no idea about programing language and its use I had to rewatch it to understand
 the basic concepts of HTML and its codes were very important as it was the only language that the computer could understand. HTMl is the language mainly used for creating websites and its contents, so we need a language for the computer to understand what exactly we wanted, that is were codes come into action , from the video that i have watched i got an understanding that a page is created with the help of bunch of codes, even the colours we see on the internet can be added or changed accoding to the inputs provided by the programmer. when we are 
creating a webpage we basically starts with <HTML>,<head>"title"</head>,<body>
"content"</body>,</HTML> this is the fundemental structure many other attributes can be added and modified to make changes to the web page, later me and adithya had a chit-chat with Mr kingston who focused in the field of testing, he 
elobrated how testing works and why there is a need for testing, while talking 
to him we got to know that there are many varieties of testing among which he 
introduced us to two, (1) whitebox testing (2)blackbox testing in which whitebox testing is done when we are aware of codes and blackbox testing is done without awareness of codes he also said that the main job of tester is to find minute
bugs such as correction in allignments and to make make a task as failure as 
it is a payment software it should meet certain standards and should not allow 
random username or password verify.
Then Mr Ebin shared his role in the company in which he took care of Know your customer (KYC) in embeded payments and merchant management system in surfpay. 
Then we had lunch and had a discussion with my mentor about framework, he 
stressed that it was very important and asked me to know about it, I googled it after a long time searching for it , I got to know what it was  with a good      example which was imagine you wanted to build a brick of 2 mm thickness and 10 mm height, it would be time consuming and a large process to find out each 
bricks thickness and height, so in order to ease our workload we create a mould of 2mm thickness and 10mm height were  we fill the raw materials required to 
make the brick of specified dimensions, here the mould act as a framework which saves us time and effort, similarly framework in the field of software is a set of reusable code that provides specific functionality, it is an outer structure of programing language that saves us time and energy.  framewors are angular,
flutter, we are mainly dealing with flutter, as I shared what I found with my 
mentor, he gave me a clarification with other example which was, making badam 
milk, it can be made by crushing raw badam adding flavours which was a long 
process, instead we could buy instant badam mix readily available in market, which saves us time and our effort, here the instant badam mix acts as framework.
Later we had a session conducted by Mr kaushik mainly focussing on problem 
solving, he gave us a question about an Island which was connected by 7 bridges there are 2 guys with a constrain that both cannot move through a bridge more than once, and cover the 4 Islands connected by these 7 bridges, we started 
thinking and thinking but couldnot figure out how can it be done, later he told us that it cannot be done, this question has no solution, were he got onto his 
point that not all problems has solutions, and we covered markdown text format.
